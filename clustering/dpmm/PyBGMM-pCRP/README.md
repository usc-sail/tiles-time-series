# PyBGMM: Bayesian inference for Gaussian mixture model


## Overview
Bayesian inference for Gaussian mixture model to reduce over-clustering via the powered Chinese restaurant process (pCRP). We use collapsed Gibbs sampling for posterior inference.

## Code Structure

```
|-- GMM # base class for Gaussian mixture model
    |---- IGMM  # base class for infinite Gaussian mixture model
        |------ CRPMM     ## traditional Chinese restaurant process (CRP) mixture model
        |------ PCRPMM    ## powered Chinese restaurant process (pCRP) mixture model
```

## Documentation

What do we include:
- Chinese restaurant process mixture model (CRPMM)
